<h3>Cryptographic Authentication Demo</h3>

<h2>Message sent</h2>

<p> A message with a link has been sent from {{senderAddress}}.
When you open the link in a browser a cryptographic credential will be
created in that browser and you will be logged in.  In the future,
once the credential has been created, you will be able to log in by
entering your email address, without waiting for a message containing
a link.
